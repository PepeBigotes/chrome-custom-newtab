THE IMAGES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED
YOU NEED TO MANUALLY PUT THE SOURCES INSIDE backgrounds.json

This also lets you add images from the internet directly,
but you will depend on the internet speed and stability of the site to get that image.
That means that your image can load slowly or not load at all, so it's recommended to 
download the images, put them in /backgrounds, and put their sources in the json.
